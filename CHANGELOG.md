## [1.3.10] - 2025-09-22

### Fixed

- **Yoast SEO REST API Integration**: Fixed `yoast_head` property in REST API responses to use custom permalinks instead of original domain URLs
- **Meta Tag URL Transformation**: Ensures canonical URLs, Open Graph tags, and Twitter Cards in Yoast head content use the correct custom domain
- **Protocol Duplication Bug**: Fixed issue where custom permalink replacements showed duplicate protocols (e.g., "https:https://domain.com") by adding validation to prevent and clean duplicate "https://" prefixes in stored domain values

## [1.3.7] - 2025-09-21

### Fixed

- **Critical REST API Error**: Fixed fatal error in `transform_url_for_rest_response()` method that was causing REST API endpoints to fail
- **Method Resolution**: Changed from undefined `get_current_domain()` to WordPress `get_site_url()` function
- **API Stability**: Ensures REST API endpoints work properly with the plugin enabled
- **Code Consistency**: Maintains alignment with existing domain transformation logic

## [1.3.6] - 2025-09-21

### Added

- **Enhanced REST API Filtering**: Fixed `guid.rendered` and `link` attributes not using custom permalinks in REST API responses
- **Comprehensive API Support**: Added filtering for posts, pages, attachments, and automatic custom post type support
- **Dedicated Response Handler**: Created `transform_url_for_rest_response()` method for proper API response handling

### Enhanced

- **Admin Interface Layout**: Improved Test URL Changes button alignment and mobile responsiveness
- **Code Architecture**: Resolved inconsistent `is_admin_context()` methods between main class and URL transformer
- **URL Protection**: Fixed conflicting wp-json URL protection mechanisms while maintaining GraphQL compatibility

### Fixed

- **Button Alignment**: Enhanced mobile responsiveness with consistent form spacing and proper button container consistency
- **API Consistency**: Proper separation of base REST URLs vs. response data handling across all endpoints
